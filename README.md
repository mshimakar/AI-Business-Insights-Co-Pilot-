# 📑 AI Business Insights Co-Pilot: Product Guide & Technical Documentation

Welcome to the **AI Business Insights Co-Pilot**, your unified platform for data-driven decision-making. This co-pilot is designed to make complex business intelligence accessible and actionable through natural language interaction.

## 🚀 Overview

The Co-Pilot is a sophisticated analytical assistant that eliminates the need for manual SQL queries or complex dashboard navigation. By leveraging **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** technology, it connects your natural language questions directly to your **structured corporate datasets (Sales, Customer Tickets, User Metrics)** and returns intelligent, summarized answers and visualizations.

## 🧭 Navigating the Application

### 1. The Chat Interface

This is the primary way you interact with the Co-Pilot.

| Feature | Description | Tips for Use |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Natural Language Query** | Ask questions in plain English, just as you would ask an analyst. (e.g., "What was the total revenue generated by the North region last month?") | Be specific with dates (e.g., "Q3 2024," "last Tuesday"). |
| **Insight Generation** | The AI returns a **synthesized insight**—a detailed, non-technical paragraph explaining the answer and context. | Look for supporting facts and key metric definitions provided by the AI. |
| **Dynamic Visualization** | If the query involves quantifiable data (e.g., trends, comparisons, aggregation), the AI will recommend and render a chart (bar, line, or pie) directly below the insight. | Use phrases like "show me the trend" or "compare revenue and profit." |

### 2. The Real-Time Dashboard

The main dashboard page provides static, real-time views of crucial company health indicators.

| Panel | Data Source | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Sales Performance** | Sales Dataset | Tracks key metrics like Total Revenue, Average Order Value (AOV), and conversion rates. |
| **Customer Support Load**| Tickets Dataset | Monitors Open Ticket Count, Average Resolution Time (ART), and ticket severity distribution. |
| **User Growth** | User Dataset | Shows New User Signups, Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) forecasts, and churn rates. |

## 🧠 How the AI Works (The Engine)

The power of the Co-Pilot comes from its specialized architecture. 

The system translates your request through the following steps:

1.  **Intent Classification & Context Retrieval:** The system determines the query's goal and simultaneously retrieves relevant business rules from the vector store.
2.  **SQL Agent Execution:** The **LangChain SQL Agent** dynamically generates and executes the most efficient **PostgreSQL** query against the live data.
3.  **Analytics Layer:** Raw results are passed to the built-in **Pandas** engine for advanced computations, such as **Forecasting** (predicting future trends) or **Anomaly Detection** (identifying statistical outliers).
4.  **Insight Synthesis:** The analytical results, along with the original question and relevant business rules, are packaged and sent to the **Large Language Model (LLM)**, which generates the final, easily understandable insight presented to you.

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### Q: What data can the Co-Pilot access?
A: It is currently configured to analyze data from the **Sales**, **Customer Support Tickets**, and **User** databases.

### Q: Can I ask for a forecast?
A: Yes. You can ask, "Forecast next quarter's sales revenue," or "What is the expected ticket volume next week?" The system uses a dedicated time-series model (e.g., Prophet) to generate predictions.

### Q: What if I get an error?
A: If the AI cannot generate a valid SQL query or finds no matching data, it will return a message stating the limitations. Please check your spelling and try rephrasing the question to be more specific (e.g., specify a date range).
